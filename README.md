JavaScript:
* diff_match_patch_uncompressed.js is the human-readable version.
  Users of node.js should 'require' this uncompressed version since the
  compressed version is not guaranteed to work outside of a web browser.
* diff_match_patch.js has been compressed using Google's internal JavaScript compressor.
  Non-Google hackers who wish to recompress the source can use:
