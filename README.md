JavaScript:
* diff_match_patch.js is the human-readable version.
  Users of node.js should 'require' this uncompressed version since the
  compressed version is not guaranteed to work outside of a web browser.
* diff_match_patch.min.js has been compressed using Google's internal JavaScript compressor.


Demos:
* Separate demos for Diff, Match and Patch in JavaScript.
